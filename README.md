OSMBonusPack
============

A third-party library of (very) useful additional objects for [osmdroid](http://code.google.com/p/osmdroid/) which is a library to interact with [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) data inside an Android application. It offers an almost full/free replacement to Android map objects: MapView, MapController, Overlays, etc.

__IMPORTANT:__ Please note that this is only a copy of the official SVN repository to make it easier to include this library as a git submodule. Do not issue pull requests and go to [the official initiative](http://code.google.com/p/osmbonuspack/) for up to date information and code.

The [OSMBonusPack](http://code.google.com/p/osmbonuspack/) library complements osmdroid with (very) useful classes:

* Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding,
* Directions (routes),
* Points of Interests (directory services),
* Overlays with nice and flexible "cartoon-bubbles"
* Support for KML content
* and more...
